FIR stands for Finite Impulse Response. It's a type of digital filter where the output is based on a finite number of past input values. It’s widely used for:

*Smoothing signals (low-pass filtering)

*Removing noise

*Enhancing signal features

**FIR Filter Equation**
The general form of a FIR filter is:
  y[n]=h[0]x[n]+h[1]x[n−1]+h[2]x[n−2]+⋯+h[N−1]x[n−(N−1)]

 Where:

y[n] = output at time n

x[n] = input at time n

h[k] = coefficient of the filter (these define the filter behavior)

N = number of taps (coefficients)

**Common Applications**:
*Audio processing: remove high-frequency hiss or low-frequency hum

*Image processing: smoothing, edge detection

*Wireless communication: equalization, channel filtering

*Biomedical: ECG signal filtering, brainwave filtering (EEG)
